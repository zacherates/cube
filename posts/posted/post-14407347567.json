Thief is great. It threatens to eat your opponent's creatures or draw you cards, which is basically everything you could possibly ask for from a three-drop. Sergeant is one the many great red three-drops. While it is a monster if it gets renowned, you generally don't have trouble filling up the slot in red.\n\n[Scaab-Clan Beserker] is a consideration if you haven't gotten an change to play it, but the colour requirements make it much harder to cast on time, and it's much less exciting off curve."}
