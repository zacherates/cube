I've already gone on at length about how it's great when ever you play, it sinks mana, and is resilient to removal.\n\nThe runner up is one of the removal spells: [Ravaging Blaze] edges out both [Claustrophobia] and [Unholy Hunger] because not only is [Ravaging Blaze] a removal spell, but it can just burn your opponent out."}
