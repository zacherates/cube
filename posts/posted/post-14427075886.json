While a committal card, in a black/green scion deck this card seems like a complete house. It's got decent stats, for a decent rate, and provides a sweet card advantage engine. Outside of that deck it's probably not as good, but it will let you cash in a creature or two that's outlived it's usefulness before cycling. \n\nOther than that I'm most interested in Hagra Sharpshooter and Vile Aggregate. Sharpshooter seems good because once you've got the mana to activate the ability combat just becomes a nightmare for your opponent, and if you've got extra mana you can even start picking apart your opponent's board. \n\nIn contrast, Vile Aggregate just seems like an efficient threat, especially in a format with value 1/1s kicking around."}
