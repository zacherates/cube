While Snare is pretty committal in terms of colour requirements it reasonably efficiently answers pretty much anything at instant speed and might be the best non-rare removal in the format.\n\n[Turn Against] has been kind of disappointing in my decks. While it  *can* be extremely sweet five mana is a lot to pay for the effect and your opponent can play around it."}
