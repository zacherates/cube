[Joraga Invocation] is a very powerful card, but one I like to pick up later once I'm in a deck filled with elves and other dorks. [Valeron Wardens], [Boggart Brute], and [Claustrophobia] are all roughly similar power-level.\n\n[Valeron Wardens] edges out the rest since once it gets renown it is just such a monster, and if you get a couple more renown creatures it does have some serious upside.\n\n[Claustrophobia] is the runner up. It is a fairly powerful removal spell; however, due to the stringent colour requirements, I have noticed if blue is open enough that I'm supposed to be drafting it, I find I have no trouble picking up more than enough [Claustrophobia]s."}
