At 4 it's serviceable, at 6 it's great, and at 8 it's backbreaking. It's also unconditional, allowing you to actually deal with the giant monsters your opponent is casting.\n\nAfter that I'm interested in Angel of Renewal as mid-game threat that flies over your opponents'  board to finish them off. After that it's probably Oran-Rief Invoker as an early game play that can be powerful in the late game as well."}
