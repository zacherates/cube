It's not the Responder is bad... it's just that you really have to build around it since without deliberate action a lot of games will be well over before you can even cast it.\n\nIt helps that this pack doesn't have a particularly strong \"real\" candidate for the pick. The runner up is probably [Rhox Maulers] which is unexciting and not really a first-pick quality card."}
