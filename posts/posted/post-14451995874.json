The Battle-lands are going to be a key part of standard mana-bases for at least the next six months and probably longer.\n\n[Eldrazi Skyspawner] is the runner up. It's the best blue common, and might even be the best common. [Titan's Presence] is a worse complete disregard that only really works in the BR Devoid deck. [Rot Shambler] is a medium quality pay-off card for BG Scions. [Unnatural Aggression] is a card that just keeps going down for me. It doesn't really fit into many green decks, since it's pretty expensive and doesn't buff stats."}
