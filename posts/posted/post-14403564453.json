Furthermore, it's one of the few payoffs for playing a more controlling deck so you can draft [Read the Bones] and [Possessed Skaab] and know that you can [Languish] away all the Topan Freeblades and Undercity Trolls.\n\nThe runner up is probably [Jhessian Thief] because it blocks well and drawing cards is great, though it's pretty close between it and [Leaf Gilder]."}
