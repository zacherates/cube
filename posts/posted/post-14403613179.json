{"cards": [398471, 398599, 398641, 398568, 398473, 398409, 398538, 398488, 398405, 398671, 398407, 398624, 398632, 398562], "notes": "[Undercity Troll] is the pick as it's probably the best 2-drop in a format defined by 2-drops. Provided you make your land drop, it attacks into anything on turn 3 and then turns into a monster.\n\nThe runner up is [Lightning Javelin] one of the better removal spells in the format which also goes to the face, and includes a value scry for some reason.\n\n[Gideon's Phalanx] is sweet, but it's really hard to get up to 7 mana in this format, so it's probably best to let someone else have the dead card in their hand for a bunch of their games."}
