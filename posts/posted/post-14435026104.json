It's not exactly news that sweepers are excellent in limited, and the fact that later in the game it's a sweeper that leaves you with a threat is icing on the cake.\n\nGrovetender Druids+Unified Front completely destroyed me at the prerelease, but I don't actually think they're good enough to take first pick. The chances that you can't actually play them seem too high.\n\nUlamog's Despoiler seems like a decent reason to actually try for Ingest, and as a 5/5 for six that keeps you pretty open it seems like a decently safe pick."}
