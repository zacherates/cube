The battlelands are the reason the standard manabase is nuts at the moment, and will continue to be important at least until Khans rotates out.\n\nOther than that, the pack is pretty unexciting. [Rush of Ice] is the second best temp-awaken spell, [Mist Intruder] is the second best ingester, [Ghostly Sentinel] is the second best five-drop for WU Flyers. I thin you take [Mist Intruder] out of archetype preference, but you're really hoping to first-pick something better than that."}
