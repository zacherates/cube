Scrying any amount and then drawing three is great, and if you build a controlling deck with a couple of sixes, and sevens in there you might get to truly live the dream.\n\nThe rest of this pack is pretty unexciting,  there are cards that go in several archetypes, but none that really pull you in. If I had to pick, I'd take [Sludge Crawler] over the fourth-best white removal. I haven't really played with it much, but I understand it's rising in a lot of people's opinion."}
