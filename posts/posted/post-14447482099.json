Not because it's good (it probably isn't), and not because it's worth anything (it's like two-fifty and falling), but so that you can say you cast it. Kind of like taking Ulamog (though Ulamog is a legitimate money pick).\n\nOther than that  [Vile Aggregate], [Kor Bladewhirl], and [Outnumber] as all pretty strong cards. [Outnumber] is probably the most flexible card so you probably want to take that and see what's open. "}
