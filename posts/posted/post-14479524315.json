It's great even if it's the only ally in your deck, and the rest of the pack is pretty unexciting. \n\n[Nettle Drone] is probably the runner up as it's a card you want a bunch of in any red-based devoid deck. While it matches up poorly against scions, pinging your opponent to death is an annoyingly viable game plan."}
