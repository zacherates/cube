Fetch-able lands are a key part of standard mana bases at the moment. In fact they're the reason all the post rotation decks, are just Khans cards shoved into four-colour decks.\n\n[Retreat to Emeria] is the \"real\" pick. It's a card that just lets you grind out advantage and then kill your opponent with one our two big attacks.\n\nOther than those two, I'm interested in [Angel of Renewal] and [Outnumber]. I've been getting Angel surprisingly late, especially since UB Fliers is one of the premiere archetypes of the format. She can gain you a bunch of life to catch you up if you're behind, and then present a serious clock for your opponent."}
