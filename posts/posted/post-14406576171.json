He's a little tricky to play because he has to be in play when you take damage for the exile ability to trigger. So, If you want to ambush your opponent, you should play him after attackers and then block and eat one of the attackers then get your exile on.\n\nThe runner up is [Topan Freeblade] over suppression bonds, but it's pretty close."}
