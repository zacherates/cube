{"cards": [398526, 398672, 398413, 398615, 398543, 398680, 398408, 398605, 398548, 398665, 398629, 398424, 398658, 398480], "notes": "This pack is not especially deep, but we still have a fairly close pick. [Tower Geist] gets the nod over [Graveblade Marauder] because while Marauder does gum up the ground in the early game and present a legitimate threat in the late game, Geist is just a fantastic value creature that provides an evasive threat. Sure a 2/2 on turn four is not that great in this format, but assuming you aren't getting your face smashed in (a big \"if\" I know), the card advantage off Geist is just fantastic."}
