Sheer Drop is likely the pick as it's probably the best white common. A close to unconditional removal spell with late game upside is pretty great. \n\nAfter that, it's likely Eldrazi Skyspawner over Tightening Coils. Sandsteppe Outcast was already a great card, and making the 2/1 the evasive creature is pretty much a strict upgrade. Coils is a decent partial removal spell, though it does allow your opponent to block all day.\n\nThe only even slightly tempting uncommon is Brood Monitor, but I really want more out of my six drops in this format since you can pick up some truly monstrous creatures. Zada, while a slam-dunk as a build-around casual card is pretty much just a Hill-Giant in limited which is very unexciting."}
