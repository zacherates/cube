Drop is a reasonable removal spell, but really something you'd be happier taking mid-pack, while Predator is one of the cards you need a critical mass of to make the GR landfall deck work.\n\n[Dampening Pulse] is worth considering if you're feeling like playing a more controlling game. While it's not good in every game, it is complete beating against any deck playing 2/2s for two."}
