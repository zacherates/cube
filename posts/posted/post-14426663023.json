As usual, I'd be concerned about taking a gold card this early, the mana in the set doesn't really seem good enough to support doing that.\n\nThe runners up are probably Murasa Ranger and Outnumber. Ranger seems like it could easily turn into a monster in the late game while providing decent value on curve. Outnumber seems like an efficient removal spell that can scale way up during a board stall. "}
