While I'm not sure how good the enemy man-lands are going to be in limited, it seems like they'll be decent trade fodder and good additions to the collection.\n\nEldrazi Skyspawner seems like it might be the \"real\" pick. It's Sandsteppe Outcast/Ghirapur Gearcrafter again except the evasive creature is the 2/1 making it a legitimate threat.\n\nOther than that, I'm interested in Smite the Monstrous. Given how monstrous some of the creatures in the set are, it seems like the kind of effect you'll want access to. Time will tell how highly you have to pick it."}
