The Battlelands continue to enable the four and five colour monstrosities in standard and will continue to do so at least until the Khans fetches rotate.\n\nOther than that [Retreat to Emeria] is one of the best uncommons in white and gets the edge over [Clutch of Currents] because any deck where the games go event a little long you can get really good value out of the Retreat."}
