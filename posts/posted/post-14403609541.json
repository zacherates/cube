Board sweepers are very powerful and [Languish] is going to let you take [Possessed Skaab] and [Read the Bones] higher than anyone else can afford to and draft a sweet blue-black deck.\n\nThe runner up by a decent margin is [Reave Soul] the best black uncommon... which unfortunately means someone is probably going to be drafting Black pretty immediately to your right."}
