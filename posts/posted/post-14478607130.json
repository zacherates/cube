{"cards": [401893, 401996, 402101, 401935, 401809, 401948, 401898, 401858, 401965, 402066, 401879, 402067, 402097, 401939], "notes": "This pack is pretty disappointing. [From Beyond] is pretty much a bomb. It lets you grind out incremental advantage every turn, much the same way [Retreat to Emeria] does. Unfortunately it's green, and green is so shallow in this format that  it ends up over-drafted with one and a half drafters at the table so a card I want to take first pick.\n\nThe pick is probably [Gideon's Reproach]. It's an unexciting pick, but it's an efficient removal spell that goes in lots of decks."}
