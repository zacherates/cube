It's reasonably efficient, has evasion and can close out a game... and that's before taking into account the fact that it can lock down your opponents' creatures when you play land.\n\n[Resolute Blademaster] is the kind of card you hope to get passed. While it's great if you can play it, there's too much of a chance you won't to take it this early.\n\n[Touch of the Void] is probably the runner up as a decently efficient removal spell."}
