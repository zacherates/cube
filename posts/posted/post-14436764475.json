Patrol is a great evasive threat that provides you virtual card advantage if it every connects while Sharpshooter and Invoker are both early game plays that have late game potential.\n\n[Veteran Warleader]  while sweet is difficult to cast, and only really great in a particular deck, so not a pick I want to take early, but someone is going to be very happy to get it passed to them."}
