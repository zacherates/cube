It's one of the great allies that you want to put in any deck that can cast it.  3/2 for 3 is fine, and giving your team lifelink the turn it comes into play can really turn a game around.\n\nNext up is probably [Spawning Bed] a card that keeps you open and gives some late game power to your mana base."}
