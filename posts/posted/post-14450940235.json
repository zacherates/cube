It is also a stone-cold bomb in limited. You play it, kill your opponent's most threatening creature, and then if that stabilized you, draw millions of cards. If it didn't, at least it gained you some life and maybe got you some profitable blocks.\n\nThe rest of the cards int his pack are pretty mediocre, I don't envy the people sitting to my left."}
