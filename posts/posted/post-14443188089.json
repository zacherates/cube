It's no the best  finisher you could ask for but it can get completely out of hand, and in a green ramp deck you can pretty reliably get this down on turn four or five when you still have plenty of lands to fall.\n\nAfter that it's [Akoum Stonewaker] over [Sheer Drop]. Stonewaker is great card in the RG landfall deck and helps you apply pressure early. [Sheer Drop] is more of a mid-pack card, you wouldn't really be happy taking it here, but it is reasonably effective removal that's not too conditional."}
