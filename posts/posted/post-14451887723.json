{"cards": [401913, 401829, 401928, 401983, 401812, 401936, 401834, 402087, 401917, 401852, 401967, 401846, 401895, 402004], "notes": "[Hero of Goma Fada] seems like the perfect card to draw you into  a Wx Allies deck. I don't *know* that it's better than [Complete Disregard], but I haven't played with it yet, and I'd like to find out.\n\n[Complete Disregard] is the  easy runner up.  [Breaker of Armies] is worse than either of the 7-mana Eldrazi, and you'll be able to pick one up if you want one. {Jaddi Offshoot] is a  sideboard card at best.  [Pathway Arrows] is close to unplayable, but might have narrow application in WB Lifegain. "}
