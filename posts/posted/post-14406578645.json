{"cards": [398433, 398643, 398585, 398575, 398466, 398500, 398608, 398604, 398562, 398670, 398469, 398464, 398671, 398439], "notes": "This pack is a little disappointing, you'd really like to see something more exciting than a good common to start your draft. That being said, the pick is [Separatist Voidmage] edging out [Akroan Sergeant].  It's mostly down to just how powerful of a tempo the [Voidmage] is, and the fact that there are three common red three-drops so you can pretty easily pick up however many you need."}
