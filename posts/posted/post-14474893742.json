[Woodland Wanderer] is absurd, but unfortunately it's green. While opinions vary on just how bad green is in the format, I've basically come to the conclusion that I don't really want to take a green card if there are other viable options in the pack. Fortunately, we are spoiled for choice.\n\n[Costal Discover], [Rolling Thunder], [Halimar Tidecaller], and [Complete Disregard] are all great. I think the pick is [Rolling Thunder] but I couldn't fault anyone for taking a trip to value-town with either the Tidecaller or the Discovery. "}
