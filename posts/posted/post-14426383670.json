Outnumber is a little situational, but I could see a deck that produced even a couple Eldrazi Scions turning it into instant-speed Roast, and having a creature or two doesn't seem like too much to ask.\n\nThe sweet pick is definitely From Beyond. Getting a 1/1 that ramps you every turn and having the ability to search for the giant monster your ramping into seems gross. "}
