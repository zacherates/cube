You have to draft around him a little bit, but he gives all of your spells \"Awaken 3\" for free. While there's definitely a risk in taking a gold card as a first pick, Noyan Dar is probably worth the risk.\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the pack is pretty mediocre: [Smite the Monstrous] is probably the runner up as a solid if conditional removal spell."}
