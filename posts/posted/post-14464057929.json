If you're even a little bit ahead and can afford to attack at all she'll just close the game out in record time.\n\nOther than that, [Drana's Emissary] is a reason to be in the BW Lifegain deck. It's a little risky to take it this early as you really don't want to be fighting with anyone else for the archetype, but the Emissary is good enough that it's worth taking here."}
