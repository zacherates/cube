They're going to be decent trade fodder since the new standard needs the battle lands to go with the fetches.\n\n[Drana's Emissary] is interesting, I might be willing to take it to see if I can get there.  A 2/2 flier for 3 that drains your opponent every turn seems like it might be worth the risk of taking a gold card early. \n\nOther than that I might take [Encircling Fissure] to see how it plays. People have commented on it being better than it looks, and while I've drafted it, I haven't actually got to draw it, so I'd be interested to find out.\n"}
