{"cards": [401863, 402000, 401822, 401803, 401936, 401942, 401934, 402095, 401813, 401917, 402035, 401895, 401929, 401877], "notes": "[Drowner of Hope] and [Kozilek's Channeler]  are the most interesting cards in the pack. Drowner as a reasonably exciting finisher and Channeler because it keeps you open, and is both a ramp spell, and a threat. This early in the format, I think I'd have to go with the rare.\n"}
