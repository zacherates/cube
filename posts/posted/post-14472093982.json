{"cards": [401835, 402015, 401964, 402013, 401877, 401977, 401937, 402020, 401899, 402097, 402027, 402003, 401968, 402089], "notes": "[Rolling Thunder] is the pick. There's been discussion about whether it or [Grip of Desolation] is the best uncommon, but out of this pack there isn't anything remotely close.\n\nThe runner up is probably [Roil's Retribution] which I haven't gotten to play with much, which I suspect means other people are taking it higher than I am, but even if it's a little clunky, five damage divided how you choose can really wreck combat for your opponent."}
