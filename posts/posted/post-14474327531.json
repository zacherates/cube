The best  card is probably [Sheer Drop] and while it's a decent removal spell, I've had it stranded in my hand too many times to be truly happy first picking it.\n\nThe runner up is probably [Smite the Monstrous] which is disappointing, because that's really more of a mid-pack card.\n\nI've really come down on [Spawning Bed], while making creatures out of one of your lands seems great, I keep finding myself stretched for payables which makes it tough taking lands early. It's also sat in my sideboard too many times because the colour requirements of the format and dearth of fixing make it really hard to run a colourless land."}
