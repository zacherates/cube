While it's right on the threshold for money drafting, it's probably going to go down unless it finds a home in a constructed deck.\n\nOther than that  I'm interested in Windrider Patrol and Gideon's Reproach. Patrol seems like a decently powerful evasive threat, hopefully able to come down before the truly big colourless monsters and fly over them to finish off a game.\n\nReproach is an efficient removal spell, and while there might be some concern about whether it will actually kill the threats you care about, it is going to be very good in at least some match-ups."}
