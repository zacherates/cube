Since there isn't anything that really stands out I think I'd take the Infiltrator on archetype preference and because there's a ton of Lifegain cards in this pack and I don't want to fight the person to my right for them, especially since you really want to be the only WB Lifegain drafter at the table if that's the archetype you're going for.
