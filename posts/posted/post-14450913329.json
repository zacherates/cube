Which one you take really depends on how you feel about the various archetypes.\n\n[Giedon's Reproach] is fine, but there's a bunch of \"decent\" removal in white so that isn't really what pulls you into a white deck.\n\n[Valakut Predator] is a card you want in the GR landfall deck, but  it's kind of a step down from either [Snapping Gnaralid] or [Makindi Sliderunner].
