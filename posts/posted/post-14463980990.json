{"cards": [402034, 401902, 401850, 401935, 401896, 401872, 401977, 401934, 402042, 402094, 401834, 402045, 401939, 402072], "notes": "[Grip of Desolation] is probably the best uncommon in the set, edging out [Rolling Thunder]. Given the number of Awakened lands running around, Grip is often an easy two-for-one, and that's on top of the fact that it can deal with any creature your opponent plays, even giant Eldrazi.\n\nOther than that [Kor Entanglers] and [Tightening Coils] are the only other cards in this pack that I'd take over [Evolving Wilds]\n\nWorth noting [Snapping Gnarlid] is a key card in the RG Landfall deck, but I've drafted it a couple of times and been pretty unimpressed with the results so that's not an archetype I want to draft unless I'm really pushed into it."}
