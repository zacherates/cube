[Harbinger of the Tides] is the pick, and while normally you'd be happy picking a rare, Harbinger actually slightly worse than [Separtist Voidmage] given that it doesn't hit everything, and it has more exacting colour requirements.\n\n[Elvish Visionary] is the runner-up, but [Elvish Visionary] is not a card you want to be first picking."}
