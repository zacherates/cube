Don't get me wrong turning your scions or other creatures that have outlived their usefulness into removal is pretty sweet, but this guy is only going to be truly great if B/G scions is open.\n\nOther than that I'm interested in Courier Griffin and Cloud Manta. I think the griffin gets the nod as it blocks better, while the manta is more interesting if you're sure your beating down.\n\nOther than that Unnatural Aggression, Demon's Grasp, and Valakut Invoker are all worth considering. This pack ended up pretty deep in terms of commons, but there isn't really anything I'm super excited to first pick ."}
