[Nettle Drone] and [Valakut Predator] are probably the runners up depending on which R/x beatdown deck you prefer.\n\nSome people have been really high on [Serpentine Spike], but I don't really see it. It seems very expensive and pretty conditional since you have to target three creatures and can't just burn your opponent. I expect to get wrecked by it maybe once during the format. If it happens more than that I'll have to reconsider."}
