In my first draft deck of the format it was by far the best card in my deck. I was playing it on the splash and the versatility of being able to play it for one, two, or three is just so good.\n\n[Kozilek's Channeler] is probably the runner up as it's a threat in it's own right and also a powerful ramp spell.\n\nHonourable mention goes to [Sheer Drop] which is probably the best white common, and while it's a little slow, it just feels so good to deal with a threat and make a 3/3."}
