{"cards": [401808, 402006, 401909, 402000, 402047, 401859, 402066, 401817, 401937, 401936, 402045, 402067, 401895, 401813], "notes": "This pack is disappointing. [Ally Encampment] is not exciting as far as lands go, [Retreat to Coralhelm]  just doesn't do anything in limited, [Halimar Tidecaller] is only good in a particular deck and a 2/3 for three the rest of the time, and [Processor Assault] is difficult to cast when you need it.\n\nThe pick is probably [Kozilek's Channeler] over [Tajuru Stalwart] as a versatile threat/ramp spell, but I'd have really preferred to have some contention from the uncommons/rares."}
