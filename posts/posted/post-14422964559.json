{"cards": [398567, 398568, 398645, 398646, 398478, 398605, 398486, 398591, 398494, 398420, 398593, 398647, 398558, 398424], "notes": "[Undercity Troll] is the pick and it's probably the best green uncommon in the set. The format is defined by two-drops with renown and the Troll doesn't even need a combat trick to attack into anything on turn three. Once it's renowned, it's a complete monster.\n\n[Reave Soul] is the runner up as it's the best black common, because for two mana it can kill any of the two-drops with renown even after they hit you. Having cheap removal spells like [Reave Soul] and [Fiery Impulse] helps you survive an early onslaught and play more expensive, hopefully more powerful cards.\n\n[Vryn Wingmare] is a little bit of a disappointment because it's not actually all that good in limited, and hasn't really made much of a splash in constructed. The easy comparisons to Thalia made for expectations it just couldn't live up to."}
