One of my favourite pieces of coverage from GP Madison was the interviewee who said \"Don't pass demons, angels, dragons, or wraths\".  Those are words to live by.\n\nOther than the dragon, [Mist Intruder], [Kalastria Healer], and [Makindi Sliderunner] are all key cards in their respective decks. I'd might go with the  healer since I haven't tried to build that one yet, and I'd be interested to see how it plays."}
