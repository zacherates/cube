[Fathom Feeder] is powerful enough that taking it first can be worth it, but [Retreat to Emeria]  gives it a run for its money as it combos with itself and if you get any ally synergy to go with it at all, it can get completely out of hand .\n\nOther than that, [Nettle Drone] is the runner up by a good margin. It leads you into one of the Grixis Devoid decks since provided all your spells are devoid it can do tons of damage to your opponent. "}
