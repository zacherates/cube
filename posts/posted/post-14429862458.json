Incubator Drone is probably the pick as 3/4 worth of body for four is slightly above curve, plus there's the ramp potential.\n\nOther than that, Lithomancer's Focus is probably the next best card in the pack... but I really don't like picking up combat tricks before I've picked up any creatures since there are so many fewer spots for tricks in you deck than creatures."}
