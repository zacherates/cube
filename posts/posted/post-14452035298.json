I'd take it here and look to pick up [Mist Intruder]s and [Benthic Infiltrators].\n\nThe runner up is probably [Bloodbond Vampire]. It's a good payoff card in the BW Lifegain, and while [Gideon's Reproach] and [Tightening Coils] are both reasonable removal spells or facsimiles thereof, I'm increasingly inclined to try and pick important cards for a particular deck over situational removal spells."}
