In the right deck this can easily be a 4/5 or 5/5 trampler for three, which is just absurd. In the wrong deck it at least blocks all day to buy you time to enact your deck's plan.\n\nThe runner up is much less clear, there isn't a second card that really stands out. [Kor Bladewhirl] probably has the most upside, but it does have the possibility of just being a bear, which isn't great in the format. "}
