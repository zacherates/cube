You could conceivably steal one of your opponents best creatures and make it trade off with one of his attackers netting you a sweet two-for-one. Though five mana is a little pricey and your opponent might be wary of attacking into so much open mana. I don't know how highly I'd pick it, but it's definitely something I'd like to try out.\n\nI'm wary of taking a gold card this early in the draft, but the next best card might be Roil Spout... and even if it's not the correct pick, it's certainly more interesting than Culling Drone or Makindi Sliderunner.
