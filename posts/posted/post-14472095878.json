It's an efficient removal spell and one of the top commons.\n\n[Herald of Kozilek] is the kind of card you really want to get passed third or fourth because it's a great card if you get to play it, but it's not really good enough to go into two colours right away.\n\nThere isn't really anything else in the pack I'd be happy first picking. I mean you could take the [Kalastria Healer] and force BW Lifegain if you haven't got the chance yet, but that's not exactly a winning strategy.\n"}
