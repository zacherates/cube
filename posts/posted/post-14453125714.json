Abzan won PT Battle for Zendikar and was running four [Shambling Vent]s so their going to be decent trade fodder for the foreseeable future.\n\nOther than that, [Tajuru Warcaller] might be one of the best uncommons. If he doesn't win you the game the turn he comes down,  turning every Ally in your deck into an [Overrun] probably will."}
