[Rolling Thunder]'s reputation precedes it , and while I've drafted it once I haven't actually got to wreck anyone with it. That being said, I will probably take the sweet mythic that makes dragons. Outcast seems like the kind of card that as long as you're putting any pressure at all on your opponent before hand, if you play your sixth land and then play this guy you probably just win the game."}
