As a card that you might be relying on to get you back into the game, the fact that you might not be able to consistently Pyroclasm for 2 seems like more of a downside than the flexibility offered. \n\nComplete Disregard seems like it might be worse than it looks. It's easy to compare it to  Reave Soul, but that was cheaper and probably better positioned in the format.\n\nBlighted Woodland seems sweet as a land that Harrows, but I think I want to take a playable here, maybe I should just take it for the ramp/fixing.\n\nThat being said, I think I'd take Void Attendant over Broodhunter Worm .
