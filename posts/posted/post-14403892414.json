There are six cards you're pretty happy first picking, and two more that aren't exciting but serviceable, but it comes down to the two 4/x evasive 5-drops.\n\n[Gilt-Leaf Winnower] edges out [Patron of the Valiant] since it's value ability is going to more reliably produce a 2-1, but oh man, the people to your right are going to be happy to see this pack."}
