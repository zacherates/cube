The best cards are probably [Kor Bladewhirl] and [Makindi Sliderunner]  which mostly have the distinction of being good 2-drops in their respective decks. I'd probably take the Bladewhirl since I haven't had the chance to make the ally deck a thing, but I'm not super excited about it.\n\nAfter those two, [Smite the Monstrous] is probably the pick as it's  decent removal that kills a lot of the threats that need killing in the format."}
