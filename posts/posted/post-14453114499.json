Unfortunately, I think it's far too committal to take it first pick and hope that BW is open.\n\n[Hero of Goma Fada] seems sweet, and I haven't gotten to play with it yet, so I'd probably take it and hope a Wx Allies deck is open.\n\nThe runner up is probably [Stonefury], which is stretching pretty far since it's the third best common red removal spell.\n\n"}
