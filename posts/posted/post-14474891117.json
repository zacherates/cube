None of which are in this pack. Why is it the best common? It's an evasive threat, it's a value creature, it's reasonably efficient, it enables devoid synergies. It just does everything.\n\nOther than that I'd probably take [Conduit of Ruin] since I haven't tried that out yet and while Eldrazi-ramp unfortunately isn't really a thing in this format, I occasionally like to give it a try and Conduit might pull me in."}
