{"cards": [402078, 402080, 401908, 402013, 401846, 401818, 402033, 401877, 402017, 402089, 401858, 402070, 401974, 401932], "notes": "[Ugin's Insight] and [Complete Disregard] are very close and while the removal spell might be a hair better, I would take the sweet card-draw spell because it's much less replaceable. If you wheel  the [Ruin Processor], you can imagine scrying for seven before drawing three, which approximates Dig Through Time, which is pretty much the best thing you can do in a game of Magic.\n\nOther than those two, the [Benthic Infiltrator] is probably the runner up. It leads nicely into the UB and UR Devoid decks and helps you get your ingest on."}
