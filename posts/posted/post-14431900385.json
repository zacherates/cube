Deathless Behemoth a a big resilient threat and From Beyond as a complete durdle engine. This early in the format I'd probably take the rare to see how it works.\n\nI don't have a good feel for how conditional Processor Assault is. If you can almost always cast it, this card is fantastic, but if you need to work to make sure it's on it's value goes way down.  After all, an efficient removal spell you can't actually cast isn't worth much..\n\nVestige of Emrakul is probably the runner up. Four toughness is a sweetspot in this format with all the 3/2s and 2/3's running around, and the fact that it can't be chumped is also pretty sweet. Tandem tactics might be slightly better, but I'm wary of taking combat tricks over creatures because I'd rather have lots of creatures and mediocre tricks than not enough creatures and fantastic tricks."}
