[Jace's Sanctum] is completely unplayable. I've passed it 12th pick. The uncommons are all varying levels of begrudgingly playable. [Sigil of Valor] can be okay as a one-of equipment to help get your dorks through a board-stall. [Clash of Wills] can be mediocre, but playable early interaction, and I've lost to an all-in [Call of the Full Moon] once or twice.\n\nThe commons aren't great either: Not a single premium common of the bunch. I think I take [Eyeblight Assassin] as it's at least a playable card, and hope the player to my right passes me some good cards."}
