The painlands aren't worth money drafting, and while [Necromantic Summons] and [Fiery Conclusion] are playable, but only barely.\n\n[Leaf Gilder] is the best card in the pack, beating down and ramping. The runner up is [Akroan Sergeant], which if you've ever played against it when it's renown, you know is a menace."}
