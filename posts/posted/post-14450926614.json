{"cards": [401864, 402077, 402026, 401854, 402070, 401945, 401929, 401952, 402041, 402045, 401842, 401974, 401940, 402086], "notes": "This pack is full of landfall cards. You could take the [Snapping Gnaralid] and hope to wheel the [Makindi Sliderunner] or [Territorial Baloth] (and if you don't know you should probably be looking for outs to a different deck).\n\nAlternatively, [Kalastria Healer] is a key card in the WB lifegain deck. While it's not as good as [Drana's Emissary], you could still take it and keep an eye out for white or black cards that say \"ally\" on them.\n\n[Dust Stalker] isn't really a consideration, because while almost all the cards suggest an archetype, since it's only castable in RB, it's something you'd much rather get passed.\n\n[Deatless Behemoth] while it is a card I like because it fits in pretty much any deck, is pretty replaceable, there are a lot of big colourless monsters floating around the table so at this point I'd much rather spend my pick trying to pick up a key card for an archetype.\n\n[Turn Against] is a card that seems to have gone way down for everybody. Actually passing with five mana open and getting your opponent is really tough. At which point it turns into expensive [Act of Treason]."}
