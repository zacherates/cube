It is a decent threat and absurd value card, in addition to being a legitimate money pick.\n\nOther than that, I've been really impressed with [Deathless Behemoth]. It's a resilient threat that is immune to [Sheer Drop] that you can play in pretty much any deck. That being said, you do only have so much spots for 6-drops, so [Touch of the Void] is worth considering as a reasonably efficient piece of removal."}
