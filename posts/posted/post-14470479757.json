It is extremely flexible giving either early interaction or a finisher depending on what you need when you draw it, and it's hard to ask for more.\n\nThe runner up is [Benthic Infiltrator] which is hands down the best ingester. It triggers ingest reliably and while not a good blocker, isn't completely useless on defence: The fourth point of toughness being key against the R/G Landfall deck. "}
