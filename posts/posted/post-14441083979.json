{"cards": [401973, 402000, 402006, 401946, 401939, 401895, 402085, 402097, 401809, 401917, 402089, 402021, 402042, 401827], "notes": "[Omnath] poses an interesting question, because while he's clearly awesome, he's even harder to cast than a regular gold card. Red-red-green-green is extremely demanding in terms of colour requirements, and it's a 7-drop on top of that. In the end it's the money pick, I'd hope to end up in heavy green-red, but realize there's a good chance it doesn't happen.\n\nOther than that [Smite the Monstrous] is a decent removal spell.\n\n[Unnatural Aggression] has been surprisingly bad in my decks. The fact that it doesn't give any bonuses makes it really hard to use profitably, even at instant speed."}
