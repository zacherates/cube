Battlelands: Boring picks, but worth money.\n\n[Forerunner of Slaughter] and [Herald of Kozilek] are both interesting cards, but I'd really prefer to get passed them because taking them first pick means there's such a high probability that you won't get to play them. That being said, the rest of the pack is eminently disappointing. The only notable common is [Makindi Sliderunner] which is a key card in the RG Landfall deck, but I'm not sure I want that deck. I've drafted it a couple of times when I felt like it was the right deck for my seat and then felt like I could win if my opponent played an X/4."}
