[Prism Array], [Retreat to Coralhelm] and [Scythe Leopard] are all close to unplayable, and there aren't any top tier commons.\n\n[Molten Nursery] is probably an aspirational pick here, but it's not like you're really giving anything up to take it. Other than that [Kozilek's Sentinel] is a fine 2-drop in a BR or UR devoid deck."}
