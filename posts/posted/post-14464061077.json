[Scatter to the Winds] isn't really worth enough to be a money pick, and counter spells just aren't good enough in limited for it to be worth taking. \n\nHonestly, I'm not even sure what to take from this pack [Murk Strider] and [Ruin Processor] are good payoff cards in UB Ingest, but you really want to pick up the ingesters first. I mean, I guess I'll take [Scatter to the Winds] for my Esper deck, and hope to get passed strong signals."}
