While there's been some griping about how there are far too many phoenixes running around for this particular set's iteration to feel mythic. A resilient evasive threat is still a great card in limited. Especially since between it being efficiently costed, and having haste means that you're going to get in for some damage before your opponent even has the chance to spend removal on it.\n\nThe runner up  is probably [Ulamog's Despoiler] as a reasonable threat that keeps you relatively open."}
