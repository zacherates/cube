{"cards": [398501, 398474, 398496, 398463, 398634, 398656, 398452, 398662, 398405, 398465, 398600, 398563, 398608, 398606], "notes": "I have been surprisingly unimpressed by [Gaea's Revenge]. I mean it's huge, it has haste, and it's pretty resilient to removal, but in my experience it just gets chump blocked all day. You can't even [Rogue's Passage] it in, and nothing can give it trample other than [Somberwald Alpha].\n\n[Leaf Gilder] is the pick. It's the probably best green common because it's a 2-drop that helps you ramp out an early [Rhox Maulers] or other monster.\n\nThe runner up is [Separatist Voidmage] which is probably the best blue common because bouncing a creature and getting a 2/2 left over is such a big tempo swing. It gets the nod over [Unholy Hunger] because while Hunger is unconditional removal it's so expensive that you can't run a lot of them in your deck. Since it's a common, any black deck can reasonably expect to pick up one [Unholy Hunger] which is pretty close to the right number without prioritizing them too highly.\n"}
