The fact that it is a threat in it's own right and doesn't commit you to a colour is just icing on the cake.\n\nForerunner of Slaughter is a card I'm interested in as it's supper aggressive and pretty pushed, but I don't really want to take a dual coloured card first pick, especially since splashing an aggressive card doesn't do anyone any good.\n\nOther than that I'm interested in Halimar Tidecaller and Oran-Rief Invoker."}
