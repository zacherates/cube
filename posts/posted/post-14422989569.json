Not only is Hangarback worth $20, it's a complete house. It fits in anywhere in your curve, it sinks mana, and it's decently resilient to removal. About the only bad thing you can say about it is that it's not very efficient.\n\nThe runner up is [Fiery Impulse] over [Topan Freeblade] since Impulse kills Freeblade."}
