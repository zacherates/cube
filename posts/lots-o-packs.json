I've already gone on at length about how it's great when ever you play, it sinks mana, and is resilient to removal.\n\nThe runner up is one of the removal spells: [Ravaging Blaze] edges out both [Claustrophobia] and [Unholy Hunger] because not only is [Ravaging Blaze] a removal spell, but it can just burn your opponent out."}

While [Whirler Rogue] is indeed one of the best uncommons in the set 7 power for 5, 5 of it flying does edge it out. Even if the demon dies to [Dissipate]."}
